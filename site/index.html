<h1>7 out of 10 Elementary School Kids Will Struggle in Middle School Math—Is Yours One?</h1>

<p>Fluency is a prerequisite for all higher-order math. 61% of fourth graders and 72% of eighth graders did not reach NAEP proficiency levels in math<sup><a href="#naep2024">1</a></sup>. This is not an issue of motivation or effort. It is the result of a broken system.</p>

<hr style="margin: 2em 0;" />

<h2>What Has Gone Wrong</h2>

<h3>Coverage over Fluency</h3>
<p>Curricula advance before students are ready. The system values exposure to material more than internalization of it. As a result, students accumulate gaps year after year. By the time they reach middle school, many have lost confidence in math entirely. Research from Education Week<sup><a href="#sparks2023">2</a></sup> and the Journal of Direct Instruction<sup><a href="#snider2004">3</a></sup> confirms that premature pacing undermines both comprehension and long-term retention.</p>

<h3>Delayed Feedback</h3>
<p>Most learning platforms and classrooms provide feedback only at the end of a problem or exercise. By then, the moment for correction has passed. Cognitive science consistently shows that feedback is most effective when it is immediate and specific. Without it, misconceptions calcify. Real-time, step-level correction has been shown to significantly improve retention and transfer<sup><a href="#koskinen2022">4</a>, <a href="#mitchell2016">5</a>, <a href="#mcneil2025">6</a></sup>.</p>

<h3>Superficial Gamification</h3>
<p>The dominant model in educational apps is to decorate weak pedagogy with coins, pets, and streaks. These reward systems may boost usage metrics but do little to improve actual fluency. As documented in multiple studies<sup><a href="#smiderle2020">7</a>, <a href="#ucf2024">8</a>, <a href="#aps2025">9</a></sup>, extrinsic motivators that are not tied to skill progression fail to produce meaningful gains.</p>

<h2>How MathStairs Drives Research-Backed Learning</h2>



<p>Unlike systems that rely on delayed correction or superficial gamification, MathStairs supports mastery through structured variation, metacognitive reinforcement, and problem formats that mirror authentic paper-based computation. Students receive precisely the practice they need, when they need it—building fluency, accuracy, and transfer through deliberate design.</p>


<h3>Practice</h3>
<p>Fluency requires targeted, adaptive practice. Students need to be challenged at the right level. Practice must be frequent, structured, and designed to adapt to individual error patterns. This approach leads to durable learning and transfer, unlike broad coverage models that prioritize exposure over mastery<sup><a href="#khan2023">10</a></sup>.</p>

      <td>Arithmetic is the foundation for all other math. Kids missing fluency here will struggle</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Basic input, no carry digits, no paper-like structure</td>
      <td>Students solve full problems with carry digits, like on paper</td>

    </tr>
    <tr>

      <td>Varies problems by removing answer digits, operand digits, or carry digits</td>
      <td>Built-in variation and interleaved practice strengthen fluency and flexibility</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>

<h3>Feedback</h3>
<p>Feedback must be immediate and constructive and be made visible in ways that reflect genuine learning. Adaptive feedback systems reduce cognitive load, accelerate mastery, and support sustained motivation<sup><a href="#smartbrief2024">11</a>, <a href="#upadhyay2023">12</a>, <a href="#ladouceur2024">13</a>, <a href="#miller2019">14</a></sup>. They help learners correct misconceptions in real time and build metacognitive awareness, both essential for fluency and long-term retention<sup><a href="#deci2000">15</a>, <a href="#dominguez2013">16</a>, <a href="#mayer2019">17</a></sup>.</p>

      <td>Reviews both incorrect steps and full problems</td>
      <td>Targets the root cause. Fixes broken steps to improve full problem accuracy</td>
    </tr>

<h3>Gamification</h3>
<p>Progress-based systems tie motivation to effort, accuracy, and growth—fostering persistence without distraction. Unlike extrinsic gimmicks, they reinforce competence, autonomy, and purpose<sup><a href="#deci2000">15</a>, <a href="#dominguez2013">16</a>, <a href="#mayer2019">17</a></sup>.</p>
