<h1>Math Shouldn’t Be a Struggle</h1>
<p><strong>But for many kids, it is — and it’s not their fault.</strong></p>

<p>Most children aren’t failing at math because they’re “not math people.” They’re failing because they’re asked to solve complex problems before they’ve built a solid foundation.</p>
<p>They get overwhelmed, confused, and discouraged. But it doesn’t have to be that way.</p>
